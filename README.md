# Practical-01-->2 DebuggingApplication (C# Console Application)

## Overview
This exercise demonstrates how to declare a string variable, take user input via the console, and analyze an exception using Quick Watch in Visual Studio. The program attempts to parse the user input as an integer and convert it to a boolean. However, if the input is not a valid integer, it will throw an exception, which we can inspect using debugging too.
